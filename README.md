# Lights Out

A 3x3 clone of the original game written in JavaScript.

## To-do
- [ ] Add keyboard controls
  - Either certain keys being bound to tiles (QWE-ASD-ZXC) or
  - Single tile is selected at a time, and arrow keys or WASD can be used to move the selector. Perhaps Enter or Space will be used to press it.
- [ ] Add some metrics to further engage players
  - Counter for unlocked messages
  - Timer and best time
  - Number of perfect runs (no double presses)
    - Ratio relative to total
- [ ] Add favicons for all platforms
  - Unfortunately, I am definitely not a designer
- [ ] Add social buttons
  - Perhaps on the same screen as the win message?
- [ ] Change CSS for landscape iPhone X to actually fit screen
  - Why did you make the iPhone X such a skinny rectangle, Apple?!
