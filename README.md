# Lights Out

A 3x3 clone of the original game using JavaScript.

## To-do
- [X] Add win messages
- [X] Add Fastclick.js
- [X] Make CSS responsive
- [X] Transpile and combine everything with Babel and Webpack
- [X] Create pre-processed `win-messages.js` to decrease load time
- [ ] Add social buttons
- [ ] Fix win message font on iOS
  - Currently, does not load 'Courgette'
- [ ] Change CSS for landscape iPhone X to actually fit screen
  - Why did you make the iPhone X such a skinny rectangle, Apple?!
- [ ] Add a ton of messages to `win-messages.js`
  - Honestly, it's probably the sole selling point of the game
