# Lights Out

Welcome to Lights Out. This is a small project I made in late September. It's extremely simple, yet quite addicting.

###How to play

By clicking or tapping one of the circles, you alter all surrounding circles. Circles that are lit will be turned off, and circles that are turned off will be lit. The point of the game is to turn off all the lights.
