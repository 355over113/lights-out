# Lights Out

Welcome to Lights Out. This is a small project I made in late September. It's extremely simple, yet quite addicting.

### How to Play

By clicking or tapping one of the circles, you toggle all surrounding circles - white to black and vice-versa. The point of the game is to turn off all the lights.
