# Lights Out

A 3x3 clone of the original game using JavaScript.

## To-do
- [X] Add win messages
- [X] Add Fastclick.js
- [X] Make CSS responsive (small screens are screwed, at the moment)
- [ ] Transpile and combine everything with Babel and Webpack
- [ ] Change CSS for landscape iPhone X to actually fit screen
- [ ] Create pre-compiled `win-messages.js` to decrease load time
- [ ] Add a ton of messages to `win-messages.js`
  - Honestly, it's probably the sole selling point of the game
